<%= turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>

<%# It can also be written like this: %>
<%# turbo_stream.prepend "quotes", @quote %>

<%# This first line tells Turbo to prepend to the Turbo frame with id quotes and the partial with also a local %>

<%# In ruby on rails, this two expressions are equivalent: %>
<%# render partial: "quotes/quote", locals: { quote: @quote } %>
<%# render @quote %>

<%# -> This second line, tells Turbo to update the Turbo Frame with id new_quote with empty content %>
<%# In other words, once the quote it's created, to empty the form div of the new quote %>
<%= turbo_stream.update Quote.new, "" %>
<%= render_turbo_stream_flash_messages %>
